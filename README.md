minisat-scala
=========
This is a pure scala implementation of the MiniSAT SATisfiability solver.
It is based on the original clean version of MiniSAT, which is a very
powerful SAT solver written in less than 1000 lines of C++ code.

A few areas are further simplified, standard scala containers are used to
avoid low-level implementaion of vectors, etc.

The original MiniSAT library can be found on github at
